- [Install LUA](https://www.lua.org/start.html#installing)
- Check out this repo
- Every file in src/*.lua and test/*.lua knows its own dependancies
  so you can run any of those by:
  - changing to those directories
  - running `lua x.lua`
- To use in your local system, copy what you want from `src/*.lua` into
  your own code directories and load with:
  - `Thing = require('thing')`
